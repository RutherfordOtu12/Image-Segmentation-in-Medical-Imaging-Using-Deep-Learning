# Image-Segmentation-in-Medical-Imaging-Using-Deep-Learning
In the realm of skin disease detection, image segmentation plays a crucial role in handling difficulties faced by dermatologist when diagnosing lesions with the naked eye (manually). This project aims to address this limitation by developing a robust and efficient model for precise automated demarcation of anatomical structures.  The project used an open-source training dataset of images from the 2018 International Skin Imaging Collaboration (https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/#2018), which were strategically split into training, validation and test sets.  

A prominent deep learning architecture known as the U-Net, originally designed for biomedical image segmentation was leveraged using PyTorch deep learning frameworks. Key Performance metrics, including Dice Coefficient, and Intersection over Union (IoU), were used to evaluate the performance and accuracy of the model on test dataset. The model achieved convincing results demonstrating the ability of deep learning to enhance clinical outcomes. The project details the importance of automated image segmentation in facilitating improved and precise medical diagnoses in the field of dermatology and general healthcare.
