# Image-Segmentation-in-Medical-Imaging-Using-Deep-Learning
In the realm of skin disease detection, image segmentation plays a crucial role in handling difficulties faced by dermatologist when diagnosing lesions with the naked eye (manually). This project aims to address this limitation by developing a robust and efficient model for precise automated demarcation of anatomical structures.
